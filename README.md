# ofpmsg-js
This is a library for manipulating OpenFlow messages. It provides basic
facilities for message construction from sockets, files, or user programs. The
library establishes a basic set of patterns for Type Length Value (TLV) message
layer composition based on the paper [Eliminating Network Protocol
Vulnerabilities throught Abstraction and System Language 
Design](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.3336.pdf).

## Types Supported
- Message - generic OpenFlow message type
- Header - openflow header type
- View - memory abstraction for serialization/deserialization
- Data - wrapper for arbitrary uninterpreted data
- *Payloads* - version specific OpenFlow payload types
